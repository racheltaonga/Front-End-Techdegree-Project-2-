# Mobile-First Responsive Layout

 In this project, I had to build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. I was given three image mockups for a mobile, tablet, and desktop layout to build the webpage. I used the mobile-first approach. Using min-width media queries, I added breakpoints to adjust the layout for a wider tablet and desktop screens. 
 
 Using CSS, I added an additional Google font to the page and additional styling to to the links. Furthermore, I added an additional skills section to the page. 

 Broswers tested for compatibility: 

 1. Chrome
 2. Firefox
 3. Edge

 Grade: Exceeds Expectations
