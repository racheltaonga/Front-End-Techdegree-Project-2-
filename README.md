# Mobile-First Responsive Layout

 For this project, I had to build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. I was given three image mockups for a mobile, tablet, and desktop layout. I had to match the designs perfectly, where I had to write CSS to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using min-width media queries, I had to add breakpoints to adjust the layout for a  wider tablet and desktop screens. 

 I went for the Exceeds Expectations Grading where I had to: 

 1. Further enhance the project by adding an additional Google font. 
 2. Add an additional skills section to the page. 
 3. Add addtional styling to links. 

 Broswers tested for compatibility: 

 1. Chrome
 2. Firefox
 3. Edge

 Grade: Exceeds Expectations
